                <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
                <p>Dr. John Watson is the narrator of all but four of the Sherlock Holmes tales. He is the essential witness to Holmes's brilliance, and the tireless biographer who records the detective's deeds and conveys them to the public in his memoirs. Holmes acknowledges Watson's considerable skills as a chronicler in the short story “A Scandal in Bohemia” (pp.56–61), when he urges Watson to stay and meet his new client, saying “I am lost without my Boswell.” This likening of Watson to James Boswell (1740–1795), the highly acclaimed biographer of Dr. Samuel Johnson, diarist, and lawyer, is an accolade indeed.</p>
                <p>Watson is a simple but ingenious literary device. With Watson addressing the reader directly, the narrative becomes immediate and engaging. He explains what is going on and the reader identifies with him, following his ups and downs as he witnesses Holmes in action, and experiences bafflement and wonder. And since Holmes's arrival at the truth generally takes Watson by surprise, the reader also feels the thrill of discovery when the time comes for Holmes
                to reveal it.</p>
                <p>In A Study in Scarlet, the reader learns that Watson qualified as a medical doctor at St. Bartholomew's   Hospital in London in 1878, suggesting he was born around  1853. After qualifying, he signed up as an army surgeon with the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers and was posted to the Second Afghan War, where he was shot at the Battle of      Maiwand in July 1880, in the arm or the leg—the narratives are confusing on this detail. While recovering in        the hospital, he became ill with typhoid and was sent home with his health “irretrievably ruined”, and was discharged from the army with a meager pension. </p>
                <p> With apparently no family to turn to, Watson was left adrift in London. It was at this low point that Stamford, Watson's old friend from medical school, introduced him to Sherlock Holmes, who was looking for someone to share his lodgings at 221B Baker Street. Thereafter, much of Watson's life revolved around Holmes and his escapades. At some point, however, Watson moved out of 221B and became a successful medical practitioner. Holmes has such respect for Watson's expertise that he keeps him at a distance to stop him from seeing through his feigned illness in “The Adventure of the Dying Detective” (pp.234–35).</p>
